# pythonproject
Python Project I worked on to clean up text file data and use the Tkinter GUI to sort data

Gitanimal is the Python code that processes the data and runs the gui interface through the shell.
Animal.txt is the actual data created for the processing example.
This python script was created using Thonny.
